Apparently this is not mandatory, although i\u0027ve seen some references in other doc to use:\n\n    user.name: \u0027github-actions[bot]\u0027\n    user.email: \u0027github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\u0027\n\nGiven that when a mail address has a +, only the part before it is relevant, i don\u0027t like using  41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com. I\u0027d say to not set user.name and user.email, to avoid impersonation of gh-pages branch or using:\n\n    user.name: \u0027github-actions[bot]\u0027\n    user.email: \u0027github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\u0027\n    \n\n- To actually deploy it, okd is using :\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          publish_dir: ./public\n          \n          \nAnyway, other documentation points to use mkdocs gh-deploy, so we can probably test with it.\n\nOne last point, as per doc https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs#building-with-github_token we may need to make some manual configuration in the repo from gh webui.",
