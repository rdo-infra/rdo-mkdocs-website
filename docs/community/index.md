### IRC channels

Come chat in real-time with RDO users on **IRC** on the [OFTC](http://oftc.net) server:

* **#rdo**: Any general conversation about RDO, including developer issues and user questions. ([Transcripts.](http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23rdo/))

* **#openstack**: Remember that RDO is just a small part of a larger community. Questions about OpenStack in general, not specifically about RDO, should go to the upstream channel. ([Transcripts.](http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack/))


Come chat in real-time with the CentOS Cloud SIG  on **IRC** on the [Libera Chat](http://libera.chat) server:

* **#centos-cloud**: If you have questions about the CentOS [Cloud Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://sigs.centos.org/cloud/) and the parts of the RDO infrastructure that run in the CentOS Community Build System (cbs), this is where you're most likely to get answers.
* **#centos-devel**: If you have questions about the CentOS Project

### IRC meetings

We have weekly IRC meetings you can participate in:

* [RDO meetings @ every Wednesday at 14:00 UTC on #rdo on OFTC](community-meeting.md)
