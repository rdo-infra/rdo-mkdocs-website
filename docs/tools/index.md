# Installing and configuring RDO


For an initial test deployment, follow the [Packstack](/use/packstack) instructions. While using Packstack is sufficient as a proof of concept, there are other ways that you can
use to deploy OpenStack with RDO. If you need to deploy a production-ready cloud with an OpenStack Zed or earlier release, possibly with HA, see the [TripleO quickstart](/tripleo).

### Tools used in RDO

* [DLRN: What it is, what we use it for](/what/dlrn/)
* [rdopkg: swiss army knife for RDO packagers](/documentation/intro-packaging/#rdopkg)
* [rdoinfo: RDO packages metadata](/documentation/intro-packaging/#rdoinfo)
* [SoftwareFactory](https://www.rdoproject.org//blog/2017/06/introducing-Software-Factory-part-1/)
