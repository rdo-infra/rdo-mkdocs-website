# What is RDO?

RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We have documentation to help get started, mailing lists where you can connect with other users, and community-supported packages of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor â€” and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.
